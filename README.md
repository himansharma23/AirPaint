 steps for building an Air Canvas using OpenCV and Mediapipe for hand landmarks detection and tracking:

Install the necessary requirements: Python 3, NumPy, OpenCV, and Mediapipe.
Read the frames from the camera and convert them to the HSV color space for easier color detection.
Create a canvas frame where the drawings will appear and add ink buttons or controls to choose the desired color.
Configure the Mediapipe initialization to detect only one hand.
Use the Mediapipe hand detector to detect the landmarks on the hand by passing the RGB frame.
Retrieve the landmark coordinates of the forefinger and store them in an array for each frame.
To visualize the drawing, draw the stored points from the array on both the frames and the canvas.
Repeat the process for each subsequent frame to continuously update the canvas based on hand movements.
Note: This implementation assumes prior knowledge of the basics of Python and OpenCV and familiarity with the installation and usage of the required libraries. The code implementation may vary depending on the specific programming language used with OpenCV support.
